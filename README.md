Before switching to Vim I had been using Atom and SublimeText. Can't express how
amazing Vim is.  It feels like you're programming your programming.  Expect a
1-2 week learning curve but then you will start flying.


# Todos
- Write a good README
- Create a tutorial for helping students to understand the Vim way
- Put together a collection of all the best resources that help me to learn vim
- Design my own color scheme
- Explain why I use certain plugins and how to maximize their use as a Rubyist

# Credits
Most of what I have so far has been taken from my mentor [Eric](https://github.com/heroiceric/) who got his start
from the [thoughtbot
